These are exponentially increasing demand for computing power, capturing the attention of management teams and the public, and accelerating experimentation. These developments are occurring against a backdrop of rising global competition as countries and corporations race to secure leadership in producing and applying these strategic technologies.\n\nThis year‚Äôs McKinsey Technology Trends Outlook provides in-depth perspectives on 13‚Äîa ‚Äúbaker‚Äôs dozen‚Äù‚Äîfrontier technology trends with the potential to transform global business. Executives today face a mandate to navigate rising complexity, scale emerging solutions, and build trust in a world where the lines between digital and physical and centralized and decentralized continue to blur. The insights in this report can help business leaders decide which of these frontier technologies are most relevant to their companies by demonstrating how others are starting to apply them today. These findings emerge from our analysis of quantitative measures of interest, innovation, equity investment, and talent that underpin each of the 13 trends and explore the underlying technologies, uncertainties, and questions around them. (For more about our research, please see the sidebar, ‚ÄúResearch methodology.‚Äù)\n\nShare\n\nSidebar\n\nResearch methodology\n--------------------\n\n**To assess** the development of each of the 13 technology trends highlighted in this report, we collected data on six tangible measures of activity: search engine queries, news articles, patents, research publications, equity investment, and talent demand. For each measure or vector, we used a defined set of data sources to find occurrences of keywords associated with each of the trends, screened those occurrences for valid mentions of activity, and indexed the resulting numbers of mentions on a 0‚Äì1 scoring scale relative to the trends studied. The innovation score combines the patents and research scores; the interest score combines the news and search scores. (While we recognize that an interest score can be inflated by deliberate efforts to stimulate news and search activity, we believe that each score fairly reflects the extent of discussion and debate about a given trend.) Investment measures the flows of funding from the capital markets to companies linked with the trend. Data sources for the scores include the following:\n\n*   _Patents._ Data on patent filings are sourced from Google Patents, which highlights data on the number of patents granted.\n*   _Research._ Data on research publications are sourced from The Lens.\n*   _News._ Data on news articles are sourced from Factiva.\n*   _Searches._ Data on search engine queries are sourced from Google Trends.\n*   _Equity investment._ Data on private-market and public-market capital raises across venture capital and corporate and strategic M&A, including joint ventures; private equity investments, including buyouts and private investment in public equity; and public investments, including IPOs, are sourced from PitchBook. Investment data excludes corporate capital and operational expenditures.\n*   _Talent demand._ The number of job postings is sourced from McKinsey‚Äôs proprietary Organizational Data Platform, which stores licensed, de-identified data on publicly available professional profiles and job postings. Data are drawn primarily from English-speaking countries.\n\nIn addition, we updated the selection and definition of trends from last year‚Äôs report to reflect the evolution of technology trends:\n\n*   An overarching artificial intelligence category replaces these four trends: applied AI, generative AI, industrializing machine learning, and next-generation software development.\n*   The agentic AI and application-specific semiconductors trends have been added since last year‚Äôs publication.\n*   Two separate trends from last year, electrification and renewables and climate technologies beyond electrification, have been combined into a single trend: future of energy and sustainability technologies.\n\nThe data sources and keywords have been updated. For equity investment insights into the future of space technologies and quantum technologies, we built on research from McKinsey‚Äôs Aerospace & Defense Practice and the Quantum Technology Monitor.\n\nInsights gathered from McKinsey expert interviews were utilized to assign enterprise-wide adoption scores (on a 1‚Äì5 scale) for each trend, defined as follows:\n\n*   _1‚ÄîFrontier innovation._ This technology is still nascent, and few organizations are investing in or applying it. It is largely unproven in a business context.\n*   _2‚ÄîExperimentation._ Organizations are testing the functionality and viability of the technology with small-scale prototypes, typically without a focus on a near-term ROI. Few companies are scaling or have fully scaled the technology.\n*   _3‚ÄîPiloting._ Organizations are deploying the technology in the first few business use cases, via pilot projects or limited implementation, to test its feasibility and effectiveness.\n*   _4‚ÄîScaling in progress._ Organizations are scaling the deployment and adoption of the technology across the enterprise. \n*   _5‚ÄîFully scaled._ Organizations have fully deployed and integrated the technology across the enterprise. It has become the standard and is being used at a large scale as companies have recognized the value and benefits of the technology.\n\nThis outlook highlights transformative trends that are driving innovation and addressing critical challenges across sectors. Artificial intelligence stands out not only as a powerful technology wave on its own but also as a foundational amplifier of the other trends. Its impact increasingly occurs via a combination with other trends, as AI both accelerates progress within individual domains and unlocks new possibilities at the intersections‚Äîaccelerating the training of robots, advancing scientific discoveries in bioengineering, optimizing energy systems, and much more. The evolution of AI solutions in the marketplace increasingly combines aspects of trends we previously analyzed separately as applied AI and generative AI, so this year, they are examined together.\n\nEven as excitement about AI applications and their use cases builds, realizing AI‚Äôs full potential across sectors will require continued innovations to manage computing intensity, reduce deployment costs, and drive infrastructure investment. This will also demand thoughtful approaches to safety, governance, and workforce adaptation, creating a wide range of opportunities for industry leaders, policymakers, and entrepreneurs alike.\n\n[](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-top-trends-in-tech)\nNew and notable\n---------------\n\nIn addition to the growing reach of AI, another new trend we have chosen to highlight in this year‚Äôs report is [agentic AI](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/seizing-the-agentic-ai-advantage), which has rapidly emerged as a major focus of interest and experimentation in enterprise and consumer technology. Agentic AI combines the flexibility and generality of AI foundation models with the ability to act in the world by creating ‚Äúvirtual coworkers‚Äù that can autonomously plan and execute multistep workflows. Although quantitative measures of interest and equity investment levels are as yet relatively low compared with more established trends, agentic AI is among the fastest growing of this year‚Äôs trends, signaling its potentially revolutionary possibilities.\n\n##### How relevant and useful is this article for you?\n\n### Most Popular Insights\n\n1.

[**Seizing the agentic AI advantage**](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/seizing-the-agentic-ai-advantage)\n\nAI is also the primary catalyst for another trend we highlight this year: application-specific semiconductors. While [Moore‚Äôs Law](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-next-innovation-revolution-powered-by-ai)and the semiconductor layer of the technology stack have long been key enablers of other tech trends, innovations in semiconductors have spiked as reflected in quantitative metrics such as number of patents. These innovations have come in response to exponentially higher demands for computing capacity, memory, and networking for AI training and inference, as well as a need to manage cost, heat, and electric power consumption. This has given rise to a slew of new products, new competitors, and new ecosystems.\n\nTechnology trends also have a variety of profiles along the dimensions we analyzed. AI is a widely applicable, general-purpose technology with use cases in every industry and business function‚Äîand thus lots of innovation and interest‚Äîand it is scaling rapidly across the business landscape. Quantum technologies have a different profile. Quantum computing has the potential for transformative impact in certain critical domains, such as cryptography and material science, and the basic technology continues to be developed. Recent announcements, particularly by technology giants, have sparked increased interest, but real-world business impact will require even more technology advancements to make quantum computing practical. Other trends and subtrends vary across the multiple dimensions we analyzed, offering different approaches‚Äîfrom watchful waiting to aggressive deployment‚Äîto business leaders depending on their industries and competitive positions.\n\nFrom the rise of robotics and autonomous systems to the imperative for responsible AI innovations, this year‚Äôs technology developments underscore a future where technology is more adaptive, collaborative, and integral to solving global problems. This is illuminated by themes that cut across trends this year:\n\n*   _The rise of autonomous systems._ Autonomous systems, including physical robots and digital agents, are moving from pilot projects to practical applications. These systems aren‚Äôt just executing tasks; they‚Äôre starting to learn, adapt, and collaborate. Autonomy is moving toward broad deployment, whether through coordinating last-mile logistics, navigating dynamic environments, or acting as virtual coworkers, among other skills.\n*   _New human‚Äìmachine collaboration models._ Human‚Äìmachine interaction is entering a new phase defined by more natural interfaces, multimodal inputs, and adaptive intelligence. From immersive training environments and haptic robotics to voice-driven copilots and sensor-enabled wearables, technology is becoming more responsive to human intent and behavior. This evolution is shifting the narrative [from human replacement to augmentation](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/keeping-artificial-intelligence-real)‚Äîenabling more natural, productive collaboration between people and intelligent systems. As machines get better at interpreting context, the boundary between operator and cocreator continues to dissolve.\n*   _Scaling challenges._ The surging demand for compute-intensive workloads, especially from gen AI, robotics, and immersive environments, is creating new demands on global infrastructure. Data center power constraints, physical network vulnerabilities, and rising compute demands have exposed cracks in global infrastructure. But the challenge isn‚Äôt just technical: Supply chain delays, labor shortages, and regulatory friction around grid access and permitting are slowing deployments. As a result, scaling now means solving not only for technical architecture and efficient design but also for the messy, real-world challenges in talent, policy, and execution.\n*   _Regional and national competition._ Global competition over critical technologies has intensified. Countries and corporations have doubled down on sovereign infrastructure, localized chip fabrication, and funding technology initiatives such as quantum labs. This push for self-sufficiency isn‚Äôt just about security; it‚Äôs about reducing exposure to geopolitical risk and owning the next wave of value creation. The result is a new era of tech-driven competition where nations have a stake in critical industries.\n*   _Scale and specialization are growing simultaneously._ Growth on these vectors is enabled by innovation in cloud services and advanced connectivity. On one hand, we see rapid growth in general-purpose model training infrastructure in vast, power-hungry data centers, while on the other, we observe accelerating innovation ‚Äúat the edge,‚Äù with lower-power technology embedded in phones, cars, home controls, and industrial devices. This is creating ecosystems that deliver massive large language models with staggering parameter counts, as well as a growing range of domain-specific AI tools that can run almost anywhere. Leaders will balance centralized scale with localized control: Think modular microgrids for clean energy or bespoke robotics for niche manufacturing.\n*   _Responsible innovation imperatives._ As technologies become more powerful and more personal, trust is increasingly the gatekeeper to adoption. Companies face growing pressure to demonstrate transparency, fairness, and accountability, whether in AI models, gene editing pipelines, or immersive platforms. Ethics are no longer just the right thing to do but rather strategic levers in deployment that can accelerate‚Äîor stall‚Äîscaling, investment, and long-term impact.\n\nThe following illustrations show how different frontier technologies can work together to provide innovative solutions in the future:\n\nAfter a year in which the macroeconomic environment and broader market weakness provoked significant declines in equity financing for technology across several of our trends, the investment climate for frontier technologies stabilized and, in many cases, rebounded in 2024. Levels of equity investment in trends such as cloud and edge computing, bioengineering, and space technologies increased despite the broader market dip in 2023, while investments in other trends, such as AI and robotics, dipped only to recover to higher levels in 2024 than they achieved two years prior. The two trends with the highest levels of equity investment, the future of energy and sustainability technologies and the future of mobility, declined overall in 2023, but the former bounced back in 2024 (exhibit).\n\nExhibit \n\n![Image 12: Equity investments increased in ten of 13 technology trends in 2024.](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/mckinsey%20digital/our%20insights/the%20top%20trends%20in%20tech%202025/pub-techtrends-investments-l0-v11.svg?cq=50&cpy=Center)\n\nWe strive to provide individuals with disabilities equal access to our website.

For executives, success will hinge on identifying high-impact domains in which they can apply these trends, investing in the necessary talent and infrastructure, and addressing external factors like regulatory shifts and ecosystem readiness. By fostering collaboration, bridging ecosystem gaps, and maintaining a long-term vision, leaders can accelerate adoption and position their organizations to drive the next wave of technological transformation. Those who act with focus and agility will not only unlock new value but also shape the future of their industries and the future of today‚Äôs emerging frontier technologies.\n\n[](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-top-trends-in-tech)\n\n**Adoption rate,** score\n\n(1 = frontier innovation;\n\n5 = fully scaled)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nThe 13 tech trends\n------------------\n\nThis report lays out considerations for all 13 technology trends. For easier consideration of related trends, we grouped them into three broader categories: the AI revolution, compute and connectivity frontiers, and cutting-edge engineering. Of course, there‚Äôs significant power and potential in looking across these groupings when considering trend combinations. \n\nTo describe the state of each trend, we developed scores for innovation (based on patents and research publications) and interest (based on news and web searches). We also estimated the level of equity investments in relevant technologies and rated their level of adoption by organizations.\n\nThe AI revolution\n\nAgentic AI\n----------\n\nAgentic AI is an artificial intelligence system capable of independently planning and executing complex, multistep tasks. Built on foundation models, these agents can autonomously perform actions, communicate with one another, and adapt to new information. Significant advancements have emerged, from general agent platforms to specialized agents designed for deep research. \n\nIn 2020, the interest score for Agentic AI was 0.0001 on a scale from 0 to 1, where 0 is low and 1 is high. The innovation score was 0 on the same scale. The adoption rate was scored at 2.

They also discussed their challenges, including unknowns regarding U.S. export bans and [tariffs](https://www.morganstanley.com/articles/trump-tariffs-2025-investing-guide) as well as constraints in power and the availability of graphics processing units (GPUs). Five key themes emerged for executives and investors to watch:\n\n1.   AI reasoning and custom silicon fuel demand for chips\n2.   Hyperscalers see cloud migrations and AI workloads as revenue opportunities\n3.   LLMs see potential in AI reasoning for enterprises\n4.   Data companies zero in on evaluating AI\n5.   Software companies set sights on agentic AI\n\n[](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt) 1. AI Reasoning and Custom Silicon Fuel Demand for Chips\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAI reasoning is one of the biggest drivers of increasing compute demand, and thus semiconductors, said executives from companies that design and make chips. AI reasoning moves beyond basic understanding and into advanced learning and decision making, which requires additional compute for pre-training, post-training and inference.\n\nExecutives also highlighted that they are investing in capabilities to meet customer demand for tailored data-center architecture, in areas such as memory and power management, and custom silicon designed for particular AI tasks rather than general-purpose processing. Customers are debating whether to buy specially designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for specific uses; ASICs offer higher efficiency and performance compared to general-purpose GPUs, which offer greater flexibility and broad applications. ASICs demand may accelerate with increased adoption of edge AI on small devices in coming years, executives said.\n\n‚ÄúFor chip companies, customer demand is in the breadth of AI workloads for programmable infrastructure,‚Äù said Marco Lagos Morales, Head of U.S. Semiconductor Investment Banking at Morgan Stanley. ‚ÄúWhat each customer wants in their data center builds is differing, and that means a much less prescriptive approach, starting with original equipment manufacturer designs.‚Äù\n\nExecutives also spoke about challenges to revenue growth, including continued foundry constraints due to the number of years needed to develop new construction sites and their physical limitations. They also underscored the unknown nature of U.S. export controls, with many saying they could not estimate the impact to their bottom lines until they know the criteria.\n\n> Recent AI advancements will harness the power of Jevons Paradox, to drive the long-term demand for AI and further increase the total addressable market for all participants in the ecosystem.\n\nDave Chen Head of Global Technology Investment Banking, Morgan Stanley\n\n*   [Tweet this(opens in a new tab)](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt&text=%22Recent%20AI%20advancements%20will%20harness%20the%20power%20of%20Jevons%20Paradox,%20to%20drive%20the%20long-term%20demand%20for%20AI%20and%20further%20increase%20the%20total%20addressable%20market%20for%20all%20participants%20in%20the%20ecosystem.%22)\n*   [Share this on LinkedIn(opens in a new tab)](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt&title=5%20AI%20Trends%20Shaping%20Innovation%20and%20ROI%20in%202025&summary=%22Recent%20AI%20advancements%20will%20harness%20the%20power%20of%20Jevons%20Paradox,%20to%20drive%20the%20long-term%20demand%20for%20AI%20and%20further%20increase%20the%20total%20addressable%20market%20for%20all%20participants%20in%20the%20ecosystem.%22)\n*   [Share this on Facebook(opens in a new tab)](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=773782963242623&display=page&href=https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt&redirect_uri=https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt&quote=%22Recent%20AI%20advancements%20will%20harness%20the%20power%20of%20Jevons%20Paradox,%20to%20drive%20the%20long-term%20demand%20for%20AI%20and%20further%20increase%20the%20total%20addressable%20market%20for%20all%20participants%20in%20the%20ecosystem.%22)\n*   [Email this](mailto:?body=Did%20you%20know,%20%22Recent%20AI%20advancements%20will%20harness%20the%20power%20of%20Jevons%20Paradox,%20to%20drive%20the%20long-term%20demand%20for%20AI%20and%20further%20increase%20the%20total%20addressable%20market%20for%20all%20participants%20in%20the%20ecosystem.%22.%20You%20can%20read%20more%20about%20it%20here:%20https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt&subject=I%20found%20this%20article%20on%20MorganStanley.com)\n\n[](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt) 2. Hyperscalers See Cloud Migrations and AI Workloads as Revenue Opportunities\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHyperscalers, the cloud providers with the greatest computing, storage and networking resources, spoke about convincing enterprises to use as many services across their software stacks as possible, to create even bigger AI platforms with increasing market share.\n\nExecutives described robust capital expenditures on commercial cloud servers and expanding their AI offerings to improve AI reasoning, as well as creating specialized applications and progress toward agentic AI. They spoke about offsetting costs with customizable chips that optimize compute performance and targeting long-term utilization of their land and construction sites.They also addressed[](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt)[recent advancements in AI](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/deepseek-ai-watershed-moment) that improve computing efficiency as positive for their businesses, as it helps reduce costs and increase AI demand.\n\n‚ÄúRecent AI advancements will harness the power of Jevons Paradox, to drive the long-term demand for AI and further increase the total addressable market for all participants in the ecosystem,‚Äù said Dave Chen, Head of Global Technology Investment Banking at Morgan Stanley, referring to the effect when increased efficiency leads to higher overall consumption.\n\n[](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt) 3. LLMs See Potential in AI Reasoning for Enterprises\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCompanies that have developed the world‚Äôs biggest LLMs intend to use the most effective chips and build the best software to offer AI services that become essential for companies and consumers. While the early use cases for LLMs were content generation, summarization and classification, the biggest untapped potential is in AI reasoning for enterprise data, LLM executives said.\n\nEnterprises are currently using LLMs for customer support and chatbots, internal knowledge retrieval and search, content generation and marketing, coding automation and business intelligence. However, with AI reasoning, LLMs can help companies with context-aware recommendations, data insights, process optimizations, compliance and strategic planning. Executives spoke about expecting further accelerations in coding advancements.One estimated that the output of a single software engineer has already risen by 10 times or more. Among the earliest industries to fully harness tailored AI to do tenfold work may be biotechnology, for clinical trials and regulatory submissions, and law, for AI-powered paralegal work.\n\nMost enterprises want AI models that can ensure the security of their data, which is why some LLMs are researching and trying to commercialize mechanistic interpretability, which aims to understand why a model does what it does. This is important for all companies, but especially those in regulated industries such as financial services. ‚ÄúLLMs are competing to deliver the best inference stack to enterprises, which includes reasoning capabilities and strong AI governance,‚Äù said Brett Klein, Head of East Coast Technology Banking. ‚ÄúWith sophisticated reasoning and adaptive learning, agentic AI will be able to make decisions and take actions to achieve business goals with minimal human intervention.‚Äù\n\nLLM executives also spoke about working with foundries to design and make custom silicon, to reduce the costs related to developing features such as recommender systems for ads or videos at scale.Many also said that recent AI advancements‚Äîsuch as continuous learning that enables adaptation based on recent interactions and updates without full retraining‚Äîare positive as software and apps proliferate, creating more real-world usage, data exposure and refined training opportunities.\n\n> Writing code has become much faster with AI, but now the value is in testing and understanding it and seeing if it works for the business.‚Äù\n\nEnrique Perez-Hernandez Head of Global Technology Investment Banking, Morgan Stanley\n\n*   [Tweet this(opens in a new tab)](https://twitter.com/share?url=https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt&text=%22Writing%20code%20has%20become%20much%20faster%20with%20AI,%20but%20now%20the%20value%20is%20in%20testing%20and%20understanding%20it%20and%20seeing%20if%20it%20works%20for%20the%20business.%E2%80%9D%20%22)\n*   [Share this on LinkedIn(opens in a new tab)](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt&title=5%20AI%20Trends%20Shaping%20Innovation%20and%20ROI%20in%202025&summary=%22Writing%20code%20has%20become%20much%20faster%20with%20AI,%20but%20now%20the%20value%20is%20in%20testing%20and%20understanding%20it%20and%20seeing%20if%20it%20works%20for%20the%20business.%E2%80%9D%20%22)\n*   [Share this on Facebook(opens in a new tab)](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=773782963242623&display=page&href=https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt&redirect_uri=https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt&quote=%22Writing%20code%20has%20become%20much%20faster%20with%20AI,%20but%20now%20the%20value%20is%20in%20testing%20and%20understanding%20it%20and%20seeing%20if%20it%20works%20for%20the%20business.%E2%80%9D%20%22)\n*   [Email this](mailto:?body=Did%20you%20know,%20%22Writing%20code%20has%20become%20much%20faster%20with%20AI,%20but%20now%20the%20value%20is%20in%20testing%20and%20understanding%20it%20and%20seeing%20if%20it%20works%20for%20the%20business.%E2%80%9D%20%22.%20You%20can%20read%20more%20about%20it%20here:%20https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt&subject=I%20found%20this%20article%20on%20MorganStanley.com)\n\n[](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt) 4. Data Companies Zero in on Evaluating AI\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCompanies in the data and cloud infrastructure ecosystem are catering to enterprises by building tools that can help them automate observability‚Äîthe ability to understand a system‚Äôs behavior by analyzing the data it generates‚Äîand creating evaluation systems for their AI uses, to help customers drive [ROI](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-monetization-race-to-roi-tmt).\n\n‚ÄúWriting code has become much faster with AI, but now the value is in testing and understanding it and seeing if it works for the business,‚Äù said Enrique Perez-Hernandez, Head of Global Technology Investment Banking at Morgan Stanley.‚ÄúData companies are building AI engines more focused on helping companies understand whether LLMs are working properly and doing the right thing for the business.‚Äù\n\nSome data companies are partnering with LLMs to power frontier models that allow users without a business-intelligence background to derive insights. Executives spoke about the importance of building custom AI tools, such as chat interfaces, that can parse through entities‚Äô structured and unstructured data, whether they are enterprises in regulated industries or countries where data must remain on premises.\n\nExecutives also highlighted the ‚Äúdata lakehouse revolution‚Äù‚Äîa trend to create unified data platforms that combine data lakes‚Äô low-cost storage and flexibility with data warehouses‚Äô structure and management features. This may involve partnerships with big corporations and other large tech companies in the AI ecosystem, to create best-of-breed AI and machine learning services for cloud integrations, cybersecurity, analytics, data sharing and industry-specific solutions.\n\n[](https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-trends-reasoning-frontier-models-2025-tmt) 5. Software Companies Set Sights on Agentic AI\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSoftware executives spoke about their current use of AI for productivity gains in marketing and engineering and their longer-term prospects to gain market share in an agentic computing future.

It has empowered employees with greater flexibility, enabled businesses to tap into global talent pools, and driven innovation through diverse, decentralized teams.\n\nAs we approach 2025, the remote work landscape continues to evolve, shaped by rapid technological advancements, shifting workforce priorities, and the growing demand for sustainable practices. Staying ahead of these trends is no longer optional but a necessity for organizations aiming to remain agile and future-ready.\n\nIn this article, we‚Äôll explore the top 10 remote work trends and predictions for 2025, providing valuable insights to help businesses embrace the future of work and capitalize on emerging opportunities.\n\n## Remote Work Statistics 2025: Analyzing the Current Landscape\n\nRemote work has seen widespread adoption in recent years, evolving into a preferred work model for employees and a strategic necessity for businesses. Recent data underscores this shift, highlighting both its impact and the ongoing adjustments organizations are making.\n\n* **Global Adoption Rates:** [Recent data](https://www.timechamp.io/blogs/40-must-know-remote-work-statistics) indicates that approximately 28% of employees worldwide worked remotely in 2023, up from 20% in 2020. In the United States, about 22.8% of employees worked remotely at least part-time as of August 2024, translating to approximately 35.1 million people. This trend reflects the growing integration of remote work into long-term business strategies.\n* **Productivity Insights:** Contrary to initial skepticism, remote work has proven to boost productivity for many organizations. A two-year [study by Great Place to Work¬Æ](https://www.greatplacetowork.com/resources/blog/remote-work-productivity-study-finds-surprising-reality-2-year-study) analyzed over 800,000 employee responses and found that most reported stable or increased productivity levels after transitioning to remote work. [Another study](https://news.stanford.edu/stories/2024/06/hybrid-work-is-a-win-win-win-for-companies-workers) led by Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom on over 1,600 workers at Trip.com revealed that employees working from home two days a week were just as productive and likely to be promoted as their full-time office counterparts.\n* **Workforce Preferences:** Surveys reveal that flexibility remains a top priority for employees, with many willing to leave their jobs if remote options are not offered. A study by Statista found that [91% of employees](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1401265/preferred-work-structure-remote-workers-globally/) worldwide prefer to work fully or almost completely remotely. This highlights the growing importance of remote work in attracting and retaining talent.\n* **Return-to-Office Plans:**\n\n  A [KPMG study](https://www.cfodive.com/news/most-ceos-expect-full-returnoffice-kpmg-remote-hybrid-work) of 1,300 CEOs, revealed that 83% anticipate a full return to office within the next three years, up from 64% the previous year.\n\nThese statistics illustrate the ongoing evolution of remote work and set the stage for understanding the trends that will shape its future. By analyzing the current landscape, businesses can better prepare to navigate the opportunities and challenges of 2025.\n\n## 10 Top Remote Work Trends for 2025: What to Expect?\n\n### Trend 1: Hybrid Work Becomes the Norm\n\nAs businesses adapt to the evolving needs of their workforce, [hybrid work](/blog/what-is-hybrid-work) models are becoming the standard. This approach blends in-office and [remote work](/blog/what-is-remote-work), providing employees with the flexibility to work from home while maintaining opportunities for face-to-face collaboration.\n\nThe hybrid model addresses challenges such as maintaining team cohesion, supporting collaboration, and fostering creativity, which can be harder to achieve in fully remote setups. For businesses, hybrid work offers the [best of both worlds](/blog/hybrid-work-tips-for-employees): enhanced employee satisfaction and retention, coupled with sustained productivity. Employees benefit from fewer commutes and greater autonomy, while organizations maintain a centralized space for strategic meetings and team-building activities.\n\n### Trend 2: Increased Use of AI and Automation\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and automation are revolutionizing remote work by [streamlining workflows](/blog/workflow-management), boosting productivity, and enhancing collaboration. Businesses are increasingly leveraging AI tools for tasks such as scheduling, project management, and data analysis, allowing teams to focus on higher-value work.\n\nFor remote teams, AI-powered collaboration tools like real-time transcription, intelligent scheduling assistants, and automated reporting reduce friction in day-to-day operations. Automation is also playing a key role in [IT management](/blog/it-management), such as monitoring system performance and implementing updates seamlessly.\n\nBy 2025, these technologies are expected to become even more integrated into remote work ecosystems, empowering employees with smarter, more efficient tools and enabling organizations to scale their operations without compromising on quality or speed.\n\n### Trend 3: Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) for Collaboration\n\n[Virtual and augmented reality](/blog/ar-vs-vr) are reshaping how remote teams connect, communicate, and collaborate. By 2025, the adoption of VR and AR technologies for immersive team interactions is expected to rise significantly. Virtual meeting rooms and augmented reality tools are enabling lifelike experiences, bridging the gap between remote and in-person collaboration.\n\nThese technologies are particularly useful for industries that require hands-on training, detailed visualizations, or interactive problem-solving. For example, a global design team can brainstorm in a shared virtual space, while field technicians can use AR to receive step-by-step instructions overlaid onto their real-world tasks. As VR and AR hardware become more affordable and software solutions grow more sophisticated, these tools will play a pivotal role in fostering teamwork, creativity, and engagement in remote work settings.\n\n### Trend 4: Remote Access and Support Technologies Transforming Workplaces\n\nAs remote work becomes the norm, the demand for robust [remote access](/blog/what-is-remote-access) and [support](/blog/what-is-remote-support-software) solutions is surging. By 2025, businesses will prioritize tools that ensure seamless, secure connectivity to devices and systems, regardless of location. These technologies are critical for maintaining productivity, resolving IT issues efficiently, and supporting decentralized workforces.\n\nModern [remote access solutions](/products/remote-access) now offer features like multi-device compatibility, enhanced security protocols, and real-time monitoring. Meanwhile, [remote support tools](/products/remote-support) enable IT teams to diagnose and fix problems remotely, significantly reducing downtime and the need for on-site visits. These solutions are not only improving efficiency but also strengthening cybersecurity by enabling encrypted connections and proactive threat detection.\n\nWith these advancements, organizations can empower their teams to [work confidently from anywhere](/blog/work-from-anywhere), while ensuring that technical support is only a click away. This evolution in remote access and support technology will be instrumental in sustaining the growth of remote work.\n\nDiscover how Splashtop‚Äôs cutting-edge remote access and support solutions can empower your business to stay connected, secure, and productive in 2025.

By 2025, this trend will continue to grow, enabling businesses to hire the best talent regardless of location. Organizations are now leveraging remote work to expand their teams beyond borders, bringing together unique perspectives and expertise from different cultures.\n\nThis globalization not only enhances innovation but also provides cost-saving opportunities by tapping into talent markets with varying wage structures. Additionally, businesses benefit from round-the-clock operations by employing teams across multiple time zones. However, this trend also requires companies to navigate complexities such as compliance with international labor laws and managing cross-cultural teams effectively.\n\n### Trend 6: Cybersecurity Takes Center Stage\n\nAs remote work grows, so do the associated [cybersecurity](/blog/what-is-cybersecurity) risks. By 2025, businesses will place even greater emphasis on secure systems and practices to combat rising threats in remote work environments. [Cyberattacks](/blog/how-to-prepare-for-potential-cyberattacks) such as [phishing](/blog/10-tips-employees-prevent-phishing), [ransomware](/blog/how-can-you-protect-your-network-from-ransomware-attacks), and data breaches remain significant concerns, particularly with employees accessing company resources from diverse locations and devices.\n\nTo address these challenges, organizations are adopting stronger security measures, including endpoint protection, [multi-factor authentication](/blog/multi-factor-authentication), and [zero-trust frameworks](/blog/zero-trust-security-a-comprehensive-approach-to-cybersecurity). Employee training on [cybersecurity best practices](/blog/it-security-best-practices) is also becoming a priority to mitigate risks from human error. As companies evolve their security strategies, tools like [Splashtop‚Äôs remote access solutions](/solutions/remote-access) are providing [enhanced protection](/security) with features like encrypted connections and proactive monitoring, ensuring data integrity and peace of mind.\n\n### Trend 7: Focus on Employee Well-being and Mental Health\n\nWith remote work becoming more widespread, businesses are increasingly recognizing the importance of prioritizing employee well-being and mental health. By 2025, organizations will focus on creating supportive environments that foster a healthy work-life balance for their teams. Remote work, while offering flexibility, can sometimes blur boundaries between personal and professional lives, leading to stress and burnout.\n\nCompanies are addressing this by introducing wellness initiatives, such as flexible schedules, mental health resources, and regular virtual check-ins to promote connection and reduce isolation. Offering tools that encourage breaks, facilitate ergonomic setups, and provide access to counseling services can further enhance employee satisfaction and retention. A holistic approach to well-being will be key to sustaining productivity and morale in remote teams.\n\n### Trend 8: Reskilling and Upskilling for Remote Work\n\nThe rapid pace of technological advancement and the evolving nature of remote roles are driving the need for continuous learning. By 2025, businesses will invest heavily in reskilling and upskilling initiatives to ensure employees remain adaptable and proficient in new tools and processes.\n\nThese programs will focus on equipping employees with both technical skills, such as navigating emerging remote collaboration tools, and soft skills like virtual communication and self-management. Companies will also emphasize leadership development to help [managers effectively guide dispersed teams](/blog/managing-remote-employees).\n\nOrganizations that prioritize lifelong learning will not only future-proof their workforce but also enhance employee engagement and career growth, fostering a culture of innovation and resilience in a remote-first world.\n\n### Trend 9: Sustainable Remote Work Practices\n\nSustainability is becoming a core focus for organizations, and remote work offers significant opportunities to [reduce environmental impact](/blog/environmental-benefits-remote-access). By 2025, eco-friendly remote work practices will play a vital role in corporate sustainability strategies. Eliminating or reducing commutes dramatically decreases carbon emissions, while encouraging employees to adopt energy-efficient home office setups contributes further to environmental goals.\n\nCompanies are also promoting digital solutions that minimize the need for printed materials and physical infrastructure. Some are even supporting green initiatives by providing subsidies for renewable energy use in home offices or collaborating with employees to adopt waste-reduction practices. These efforts not only benefit the planet but also appeal to environmentally conscious employees, enhancing brand reputation and employee satisfaction.\n\n### Trend 10: Decentralized Office Spaces and Remote Work Hubs\n\nThe era of centralized headquarters is giving way to decentralized office spaces and remote work hubs designed for distributed teams. By 2025, more companies will adopt this flexible approach, creating smaller, strategically located offices or shared workspaces that cater specifically to remote employees.\n\nThese hubs provide an alternative for employees who prefer not to work exclusively from home but don‚Äôt need to commute to a central office. They are designed to facilitate occasional in-person collaboration while offering a comfortable, productivity-enhancing environment. This model also allows businesses to reduce real estate costs and support employees in regions where access to home office resources might be limited.\n\nDecentralized workspaces are a testament to how businesses are adapting to the evolving needs of their remote and hybrid workforces, combining flexibility with physical spaces that foster community and teamwork.\n\n## How Can Businesses Prepare for Remote Work in 2025?\n\nTo thrive in the evolving remote work landscape, businesses must proactively adapt to the emerging trends and challenges of 2025. Implementing effective strategies will ensure that organizations remain competitive, productive, and employee-focused. Here are key areas to prioritize:\n\n1. **Invest in Advanced Remote Tools**\n\n   Equip teams with the latest technology for seamless remote work. This includes [secure remote access solutions](/solutions/remote-access), collaboration tools, and AI-powered solutions to enhance productivity and connectivity.\n2. **Establish Clear Objectives and Communication Channels**\n\n   Define goals and expectations to keep teams aligned. Regular virtual check-ins, transparent workflows, and accessible communication tools are essential for maintaining cohesion across dispersed teams.\n3. **Enhance Security Practices**\n\n   Protect sensitive data and systems by adopting robust cybersecurity measures. Multi-factor authentication, endpoint protection, and [secure remote support tools](/solutions/remote-it-support-software) are vital for safeguarding operations in remote environments.\n4. **Prioritize Reskilling and Upskilling**\n\n   Invest in continuous learning programs to prepare employees for evolving technologies and remote work challenges. Equip them with both technical skills and soft skills to thrive in virtual settings.\n5. **Focus on Employee Wellness**\n\n   Foster a healthy work-life balance by offering flexible schedules, mental health resources, and wellness initiatives. Create a supportive culture that values employee well-being as much as performance.\n6. **Adapt to Hybrid and Decentralized Work Models**\n\n   Embrace flexible work arrangements by combining remote and in-office options or establishing remote work hubs. This ensures employees have choices while fostering collaboration and innovation.\n\n## Revolutionize Your Remote Work Strategy with Splashtop Remote Access Solutions\n\nAs the remote work landscape evolves, Splashtop provides businesses with practical, high-performance tools designed to meet modern workforce demands.
